# NonLinear-DSA-Questions

A collection of solved non-linear data structure questions from LeetCode, focused on **Graphs**, **Trees**, and **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This repository is a resource for optimized solutions to complex problems in these areas, aimed at deepening understanding and improving problem-solving skills.

## Problem Categories
- **Graphs** (DFS, BFS, connected components, shortest paths)
- **Trees** (Binary Trees, BSTs, traversal techniques)
- **Dynamic Programming** (state-based optimizations in non-linear structures)

## Repository Structure
Each problem is organized by category with:
- **README.md** ‚Äì Summary of the problem.
- **Solution Code** ‚Äì Optimized and tested solution.

### Happy coding, and may your path through non-linear data structures be¬†ever-illuminated!ü§ù
